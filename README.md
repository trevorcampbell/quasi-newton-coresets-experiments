# Quasi-Newton Coresets: Fast Bayesian coresets with theoretical guarantees

This repository provides a python package to construct [Bayesian coresets](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05053). The code is based on that found [here](https://github.com/trevorcampbell/bayesian-coresets).
It contains code to run the experiments in [Fast Bayesian Coresets via Subsampling and Quasi-Newton Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09675).


## NB: Under construction, code will be added soon.

### Installation and Dependencies

To install with pip, download the repository and run `pip3 install . --user` in the repository's root folder.

The experiments depend on [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org), [SciKit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org),
[PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest). 

### Instructions 

In order to run the synthetic Gaussian experiment, the data needs to be generated by running the `get_synthetic_gaussian_data.py`
file within the `data` folder. This is because the dataset is too large to fit within
the size limit.

Having done this, all experiments can be run by running
`run_experiment.sh` under each directory.
To plot the results, run `make_plots.sh` under each directory.
